• Following the original design you must create the functionality to create,
edit and delete news.
• To do this, you need to save an id, the title of the news, the author, the date
of creation and modification, the content (content distribution by rows) and
the status of the news (0 for draft and 1 for published).
• You need to apply the functionality explained in the given code to design the
structure of each news item.
• The database is created and mantained in the browser’s localStorage.
• Pay attention to usability. As we have discussed in class, it is advisable to
have an option to save changes while the user edits a news item without
leaving the page, another option to publish and another to go back. It will also
be positively valued to be able to edit a table element by double clicking, etc.
